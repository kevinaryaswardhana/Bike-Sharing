## Dataset: Bike Sharing 
[Bike Sharing Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RaBmV6Q6FYWU4HWZs80Suqd7KQC34diQ/view?usp=sharing)

## Streamlit Cloud :
Streamlit Cloud : [Bike Sharing Dashboard](https://kevinaryaswardhana-dicoding-project-bikesharing.streamlit.app/)

## Setup environment
- Install Visual Studio Code for Editor
- Execute this command on command line ( as administrator prefered)
```
pip install pandas streamlit plotly scikit-learn
```

## Project installation
The steps to create your virtual environment from this project is as follows:

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kevinaryaswardhana/bike_sharing.git
   ```

2. Move to directory bike_sharing/submission/dashboard
   ```
   cd bike_sharing/submission/dashboard
   ```
3. Run streamlit app
   ```
   streamlit run bike-sharing-dashboard.py

   or

   streamlit run bike-sharing-dashboard_plotly.py
   ```
4. Stop the application program by `ctrl + c`.


*Note:*
In the dashboard folder there are 2 files (.py):
1. bike-sharing-dashboard.py: Visualization using built-in Streamlit
2. bike-sharing-dashboard-plotly.py: Visualization using an additional library, Plotly Express. In my opinion, Plotly allows for more customizable graphics.

**! There may be differences in directory structure, so ensure you navigate to the correct directory.**
